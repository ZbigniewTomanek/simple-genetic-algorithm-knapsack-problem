# simple-genetic-algorithm-knapsack-problem
This is c++ implementation of simple genetic algorithm which can find solution for knapsack problem without use of smart pointers.

## Purpose

Example result of algorithm work can be seen in console after running main.cpp. 
It uses simple and naive approach to individual selection - one parent is chosen from two randomly chosen individuals on the basis of better adaptation.

However the main pourpose was to learn manual memory managing and this is the reason of maitaing c++98 like standard.
